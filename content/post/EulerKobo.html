<p>Multiple choice question in which respondent can select more than one correct answer from the list is a usual part of almost every survey.</p>
<p>It is usually visualized as a simple bar chart ignoring the overlap between the different categories, while this overlap can bring more analytical value and depth to the analysis.

<p>Euler diagram is a perfect way to show the relationship between different subsets and thatâ€™s hardly possible to build it with the commonly used spreadsheet software such as MS Excel.</p>
<p>In R this is quite easy with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eulerr/vignettes/venn-diagrams.html">eulerr package</a>, below is the demonstration that includes data extraction from Kobo with koboloadeR package.</p>

<pre class="r"><code># download the data with your credentials
# df &lt;- kobo_data_downloader(&quot;datasetID&quot;, &quot;login:password&quot;)

#check the column names with colnames(df)

# you need to identify the columns associated with one multi choice question
# each option of a multi choice question would be represented as 1 column, 
# all these columns would have identical prefix, such as &quot;B/whyreturn/&quot; in the example below.
# these columns would contain either True or False or n/a value

 # [44] &quot;B/whyreturn/stabilized&quot;                                           
 # [45] &quot;B/whyreturn/nojob&quot;

<h2>Make euler chart with identified dataset</h2>
<p>A note of caution: there are many ways this process might look like and depending on your flow it can be changed.
In this example we just concentrate on this narrow task of building a simple Euler chart.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#select only the identified columns in format &quot;firstOne:lastOne&quot;
# dfSubset &lt;- select(df, &quot;B/whyreturn/stabilized&quot;:&quot;B/whyreturn/other&quot;) %&gt;%

#   #unfilter those with N/As (question not asked in case of conditional flow)

#   #removing the prefixes

<h2>If there are more than 6 columns</h2>
<p>you may want to limit the number of columns as
* plot might be very busy and not readable
* it is computationally heavy and may require significant resources to render the plot
under the hood there is a lot of math:
