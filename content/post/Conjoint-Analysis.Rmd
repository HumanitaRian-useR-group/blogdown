## What is Conjoint analysis?

Conjoint analysis originated in mathematical psychology by psychometricians and was developed since the mid-sixties also by researchers in marketing and business. Conjoint analysis (CA) is often used to evaluate how people make decisions between a set of different options when considering a number of criteria at the same time (conjoint features; “trade-offs”). Rather than rating the importance of each attribute separately, participants rate their preferences for profiles or products with different combinations of the attributes or criteria. CA then allows to “decompose” or reverse-engineer these ratings into estimates of how important each criteria or attribute is to a participant’s ranking decisions.

In humanitarian data analysis, this technique can be quite relevant to organize expert consultations in order to get the relative weights (or relative contribution) of each sub-indicator value when creating [composite indicator](https://humanitarian-user-group.github.io/categories/composite/) such as __vulnerability scorecard__. Conjoint analysis can speed up expert consultations by offering an __objective mean to compile expert opinions__.


As per [OECD 10 Steps guide](https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/handbookonconstructingcompositeindicatorsmethodologyanduserguide.htm), one important elements to consider is the need to explore and compare different weighting approaches before making a decision on the final formula (i.e. also called sensitivity and robustness analysis).

As usual, R offers all the tools for that. Conjoint analysis can be done with the [Conjoint Package](http://keii.ue.wroc.pl/conjoint/Conjoint_R.html), developed by the Department of Econometrics and Computer Science from Wrocław University of Economics. More details are available in their article: [Conjoint analysis method and its implementation in conjoint R package](http://keii.ue.wroc.pl/pracownicy/tb/Bak_A_and_Bartlomowicz_T_Conjoint_analysis_method_and_its_implementation_in_conjoint_R_package.pdf).

Below is re-usable tutorial with reproducible code that should help any data analyst to quickly use this weighting discovery method.

Steps of the procedure for this example include: 

 1.	Choosing the attributes/__sub-indicators__ that are used to determine vulnerability scoring;   

 2.	Determine the different potential levels for each attribute (i.e vulnerability __scale attached to each answer option__ from sub-indicators) that indicate scoring of less vulnerable to more vulnerable;  

 3.	Use fractional factorial design to __generate a number of household profiles__, each possessing unique combinations of the attributes;    

 4.	Build the __expert consultation__ form where each expert will rate each household profile from low vulnerability to high vulnerability;     
 5.	Review results and assess __agreement level__;    
 
 6.	If necessary, __relaunch the survey__ and iterate back to the previous step as much as needed;   

 7.	Apply the importance level for each critiria as the __weights to be used with the geometric mean aggregation__ for all indicators.

## Define the combined alternatives to be compared

The [Joint Intersectoral Analysis Framework (JIAF)](https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/system/files/gbna_tools_and_guidance_pkg_final_june_2019.pdf) is a theoretical generic measurement framework to be used for Humanitarian needs assessment. It specifies three distinct and complementary components of humanitarian severity and vulnerability indexes:

- Basic Needs & Living standards
- Coping Capacity
- Well Being & Community integration

![](/post/Conjoint-Analysis_files/jiagf.png)

This generic model can be contextualized in each operations as different sub-indicators might be used for each of the 3 dimensions depending on cultural and political situations. Conjoint analysis will allow to discover the relative importance to be allocated for each sub-indicator.

## Select most relevant alternatives with Factorial Design

Instead of showing every possible combination of household profiles, fractional factorial design can be used to generate the fewest number of household profiles needed (each with a unique combination of the attribute levels).

In statistics, fractional factorial designs are experimental designs consisting of a carefully chosen subset (fraction) of the experimental runs of a full factorial design (i.e. all possible combinations of answers for a series of questions). The subset is chosen so as to exploit the sparsity-of-effects principle to expose information about the most important features of the problem studied, while using a fraction of the effort of a full factorial design in terms of experimental runs and resources. In other words, it makes use of the fact that many experiments in full factorial design are often redundant, giving little or no new information about the system. 

In addition, the different profiles should be scanned to identify those specific interactions of criteria that are not rational (do not exist in the real world). Those should be removed manually.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Selection of relevant concepts
selectedProfiles.basicneeds <- caFactorialDesign(data = basicneeds,
                                      type = 'fractional'
                                    )

## need to clean up some impossible profile
selectedProfiles.basicneeds <- selectedProfiles.basicneeds[ !(selectedProfiles.basicneeds$Shelter == "Spontaneous or Squatting" &
                              selectedProfiles.basicneeds$Bathroom == "Private")  , ] 

selectedProfiles.basicneeds <- selectedProfiles.basicneeds[!(selectedProfiles.basicneeds$Shelter == "Hosted or Collective" &
                              selectedProfiles.basicneeds$Bathroom == "Private")  , ]  

selectedProfiles.basicneeds <- selectedProfiles.basicneeds[!(selectedProfiles.basicneeds$Shelter == "Owned or Rental" &
                              selectedProfiles.basicneeds$Electricity == "No electricity")  , ] 


# Checking if selected concepts are relevant for study
# corrselectedProfiles.basicneeds <- caEncodedDesign(selectedProfiles.basicneeds)
# print(cor(corrselectedProfiles.basicneeds))
```

                                      type ='fractional'
                                    )

  ## Build the expert consultation questionnaire in xlsform

Once we have the main profile options to compare, we can automatically generate the corresponding xlsform in order to build the expert consultation form. 

Since we want the expert to rate each alternative, we will need a metric measurement, particularly a Likert scale. Likert scales are per default interval scales, which means that we would only have the knowledge of how much the overall utility would increase by changing the level of an attribute. We are also restricted to an interval scale due to the fact that we chose a part-worth model as well as fractional factorial design. A continuous or ratio variable would generally not be possible with a fractional factorial design or part worth model unless we can make some assumption about linearity and interactions which are simply unrealistic. But the advantage of a Likert scale is that it has proven to be more reliable in studies. 

The rating of a run might look like this:
- each expert is presented with a set of unique household profiles that represent different combinations of the attributes together  (i.e. a "run from the experimental design")
- each expert then rates each profile  with a number ranging from 1 to 9, where the higher number indicates that the household is highly vulnerable. 9 indicates extreme vulnerability, while 1 equals low vulnerability. 

The questionnaire generation in [xlsform](http://xlsform.org) can also be automatized with a script in order to save time. We predefined the survey introduction `conjointSurvey.csv` and the choices `conjointShoices.csv`

```{r, echo=TRUE}

## Utility values: estimating the Part-Worth Models

CA produces importance values and part-worth utility estimates. Importance values indicate the overall contribution of each attribute to how the profiles were rated (e.g. whether number of meals is more important in vulnerability scoring than access to safe water). Part-worth utility estimates the relative importance of each level within each attribute (e.g. the relative scoring of one or less meals vs. two or more meals a day). A higher utility estimate indicates that this level contributes to a higher vulnerability than the level with the lower utility estimate. 

The part-worth model follows the idea of marginal utility from economics. It means it does not give an absolute value for the utility of an option, but rather assumes a reference alternative. The part-worth values for each expert can be calculated through multiple linear regression. The objective is estimate the preference share - i.e. how much a specific vulnerability criteria can contribute to the entire vulnerability score for a specific case. 

A model is generated for each expert. The estimates of the linear regression are our part-worth utilities. Part-worth utilities are interval scale variables: for each categorical variable, one level is used as reference level. This means that for one level in each categorical variable no estimate will be shown because its value will be automatically 0. 

The following code creates a data frame where each row represents a level of a variable and where each column represents an Expert.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#  get the numeric values for each part utility for each respondent.
PartUtilities <- as.data.frame(t(caPartUtilities(y = Data.basicneeds2, 
                                 x = selectedProfiles.basicneeds, 
                                 z = basicneeds_values)))

# Create dataframe with part-worthvalues
vars <- c("Intercept",
          rep("Meals",2),
          rep("Shelter",3),
          rep("Water",2),

lvls <- c("Intercept",
          as.character(levels(Conjoint.basicneeds$Meals)),

Results <- data.frame(Variable = vars,Levels = lvls)
Results <- cbind(Results,PartUtilities )
Results[,"Average"] <- round(rowMeans(Results[,-c(1,2)]),digits = 1)
```

We can now visualize the results with ggplot2

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=10, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

myplots <- list()
count = 1

for (var in basicneeds_indic) {
  
  #var <- "Shelter"
  subs <- droplevels(subset(Results,Variable == var))
  subs$Levels <- reorder(subs$Levels,subs$Average)
  if (min(subs$Average) < 0) {
    subs$Average <- subs$Average + abs(min(subs$Average))
  }
  myplots[[count]]  <- ggplot(data = subs,aes(x = Levels, y = Average, group = 1)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    unhcr_style() + ## Insert UNHCR Style
    ## and the chart labels
    labs(title = paste0("Utilities level for ", var)) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
  count = count + 1
  
}

cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = myplots, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
```




The standard deviation for each level allows to better understand how homogeneous the target group is with respect to one level. It might give us a hint on whether the preferences here considered are correct.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# The higher the utility value, the more importance that the expert places on that attribute’s level.

  
model  <-  caUtilities2(y = Data.basicneeds2 , 
                     x = selectedProfiles.basicneeds, 
                     z = basicneeds_values)

model.tidy  <-  broom::tidy(model,
                          conf.int = TRUE,
                          conf.level = 0.95,
                          exponentiate = TRUE
)

model.tidy  <-  model.tidy[ !(is.na(model.tidy$term)), ]

Results$seq <- 1
for (i in 2:nrow(Results)) {
  if (Results[ i - 1 , c("Variable")] == Results[ i , c("Variable")])
  {Results[ i , c("seq")] <- Results[ i - 1 , c("seq")] + 1 } else {Results[ i , c("seq")] <- Results[ i , c("seq")]}

## Importance of each criteria 

We can now get the importance of each criteria. These importance values will then be used as the weights for each attribute inside each of our three dimensions. The importance values sum to 100%. In the example of the bar chart below, bathroom and shelter are more important than meals, water and electricity in rating vulnerability based on basic needs. 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Importances.basicneeds <- as.data.frame(basicneeds_indic)
names(Importances.basicneeds)[1] <- "Variable"

Importances.basicneeds$Average <- caImportance(Data.basicneeds2,
                                    selectedProfiles.basicneeds)

plot1 <- ggplot(Importances.basicneeds,
       aes(x = reorder(Variable, Average), y = Average)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", 
           position = "identity", 
           fill = "#0072bc") + # here we configure that it will be bar chart  
  geom_label(aes(label = Average), size = 9, fill = "#0072bc" ,  color = "white", hjust = 1) + 
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x)paste(x, "%")) +
  unhcr_style() + ## Insert UNHCR Style
  ## and the chart labels
  labs(title = "Criteria Average importance related to Basic Needs Vulnerability scoring",
       subtitle = paste0("Conjoint Analysis from ", nexpert, " experts"), 
       caption = "Dummy data",
       y = "") +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"), 
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) ### changing grid line that should appear

ggpubr::ggarrange(left_align(plot1, c("subtitle", "title")), ncol = 1, nrow = 1)

```

## Segmentation of respondents

Segmentation using k-means method -  division into 3 segments:

This will group experts according to their patterns of responses. This way we can identify if experts from different countries are giving different importance ratings compared to experts from other countries. 

We can also see on the plot if there is a higher agreement between experts of a certain segment (segment 1, dots are closer together) vs. another. 

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

segments <- caSegmentation(Data.basicneeds2,
                           selectedProfiles.basicneeds,
                           c = 3)

# print(segments$seg) 
# plotcluster(segments$util,segments$sclu)

dcf <- discrcoord(segments$util,segments$sclu)
assignments <- augment(segments$segm,dcf$proj[,1:2])

plot1 <- ggplot(assignments) + 
          geom_point(aes(x = X1,
                         y = X2,
                         color = .cluster)) +
        unhcr_style() + ## Insert UNHCR Style
        ## and the chart labels
        labs(title = "Profiling experts contribution",
             subtitle = paste0("K-Means Clustering of ", nexpert, " experts opinions"), 
             caption = "Dummy data",
             color = "Cluster Assignment",
             y = "",
             x = "") +
        theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"), 
              panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#cbcbcb"),
        axis.text.x  = ggplot2::element_blank(),
        axis.text.y  = ggplot2::element_blank())   

ggpubr::ggarrange(left_align(plot1, c("subtitle", "title")), ncol = 1, nrow = 1)
