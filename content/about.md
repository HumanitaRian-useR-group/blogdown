This site hosts information related to the HumanitaRian-useR-group. This group is open to Humanitarian Information Management officers from any organisation. The initial group was created in November 2018 after a workshop in Amman funded by UNHCR. 


The idea is to:

- Share and disseminate some interesting approaches.

- Link up colleagues for potential code peer review 

- Organise regular webinars using different format: panel discussion, one long in-depth talk, a couple of shorter talks or open-mic "quickfire" talks...
